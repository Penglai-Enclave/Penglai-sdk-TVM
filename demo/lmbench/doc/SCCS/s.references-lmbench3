%T A new approach to I/O performance evaluation \- self-scaling I/O benchmarks, predicted I/O performance
%D November 1994
%J Transactions on Computer Systems
%V 12
%N 4
%P 308-339
%x Current I/O benchmarks suffer from several chronic problems: they
%x quickly become obsolete; they do not stress the I/O system; and they
%x do not help much in undelsi;anding I/O system performance. We
%x propose a new approach to I/O performance analysis. First, we
%x propose a self-scaling benchmark that dynamically adjusts aspects of
%x its workload according to the performance characteristic of the
%x system being measured. By doing so, the benchmark automatically
%x scales across current and future systems. The evaluation aids in
%x understanding system performance by reporting how performance varies
%x according to each of five workload parameters. Second, we propose
%x predicted performance, a technique for using the results from the
%x self-scaling evaluation to estimate quickly the performance for
%x workloads that have not been measured. We show that this technique
%x yields reasonably accurate performance estimates and argue that this
%x method gives a far more accurate comparative performance evaluation
%x than traditional single-point benchmarks. We apply our new
%x evaluation technique by measuring a SPARCstation 1+ with one SCSI
%x disk, an HP 730 with one SCSI-II disk, a DECstation 5000/200 running
%x the Sprite LFS operating system with a three-disk disk array, a
%x Convex C240 minisupercomputer with a four-disk disk array, and a
%x Solbourne 5E/905 fileserver with a two-disk disk array.

%x This paper evaluates several hardware pplatforms and operating systems using
%x a set of benchmarks that stress kernel entry/exit, file systems, and
%x other things related to operating systems. The overall conclusion is that
%x operating system performance is not improving at the same rate as the base speed of the
%x underlying hardware. The most obvious ways to remedy this situation
%x are to improve memory bandwidth and reduce operating systems'
%x tendency to wait for disk operations to complete.
%o Typical performance of 10-20 MIPS cpus is only 0.4 times what
%o their raw hardware performance would suggest. HP-UX is
%o particularly bad on the HP 9000/835, at about 0.2x. (Although
%o this measurement discounted a highly-tuned getpid call.)

%x The AlphaServer 8400 and the AlphaServer 8200 are Digital's newest high-end
%x server products.  Both servers are based on the 300Mhz Alpha 21164 
%x microprocessor and on the AlphaServer 8000-series platform architecture.
%x The AlphaServer 8000 platform development team set aggressive system data
%x bandwidth and memory read latency targets in order to achieve high-performance
%x goals.  The low-latency criterion was factored into design decisions made at
%x each of the seven layers of platform development.  The combination of 
%x industry-leading microprocessor technology and a system platform focused
%x on low latency has resulted in a 12-processor server implementation ---
%x the AlphaServer 8400 --- capable of supercomputer levels of performance.
